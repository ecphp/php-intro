## What is PHP ?

### An example

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <?php
            echo "Hi, I'm a PHP script!";
        ?>
    </body>
</html>
```

The PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions ```<?php``` and ```?>``` and is executed on the server.
