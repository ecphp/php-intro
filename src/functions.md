## Functions

```
<?php
function square($number)
{
    return $number ** 2;
}

$value = square(12); // 144
```

A function is a block of statements.

It's similar to any other programming language.
It is a piece of code which optionally takes input parameters,
does some processing and optionally returns a value.

A function has its own scope and does not interfere with the rest, unless explicitly stated.

You have to remind that you can do only 2 things with a PHP function:

* Create a function
* Calling a function
